# Summer Research 2024

## Objective

The main goal of this research is to use an autoencoder to reconstruct global data and separate forcing signals.

## Methods

We will employ an asymmetric autoencoder. The input will be global grid data, and the output will be the separated forcing global grid data.

## Data

The specific datasets or sources to be used are yet to be determined.

## Expected Outcomes

We aim to develop a neural network capable of separating climate change forcing signals.

## Collaborators

This project is in collaboration with Prof. Yu-Chiao Liang.

## Timeline

The research activities are scheduled from July 1st to August 31st, 2024.
